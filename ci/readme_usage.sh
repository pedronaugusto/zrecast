# zrecast — README.md's Usage snippet, extracted from examples/usage.zig.
#
# A code snippet in a README is a claim about how the library is used, and
# nothing compiles it. This one is a region of an example that `zig build
# examples` builds AND runs, so `ci/check-docs.sh` comparing this output
# against the document is what keeps the two the same thing.
#
# Usage: ci/readme_usage.sh          # writes the fenced block to stdout
